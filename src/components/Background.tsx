          I was born in Paris in 2001. I currently reside in Chamb√©ry in France
          and study computer science at school 42 in Paris.

          After high school, I initially studied design in Lyon in 2020 but quit
          in the first year to pursue coding. The following year I was able to
          find a job as a front-end developer in a French company and worked for
          half a year, getting professional experience and discovering how real
          world applications function.

          After successfully passing the 'Piscine' entrance concour in Paris, I
          entered 42 in November 2022 hoping to learn more about software
          engineering and meeting more people with the same passion as mine.

          I now aspire to leave my mark in the world by building usefull
          software to people.
